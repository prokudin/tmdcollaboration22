Materials for lectures of A. Prokudin at TMD Collaboration School, Santa Fe, 1/22/22

Start by cloning the repository.

Lectures are in the subfolder /Lectures

Run example.nb that shows some plots.

Mathematica exersises are 

sivers.nb
collins.nb

Choose any one. You will reproduce either Sivers or Collins asymmetries in SIDIS. Compare to experimental data if you like.

Home work:

* Choose any file sivers.nb or collins.nb. Follow the file, calculate the structure functions and plot the asymmetries. Compare your results to plots from example.nb

** Use the definitions of Fourier transforms of TMDs from the TMDbook Eq. (2.192), (2.193) and show that they give the same results as the ones you obtain in the previous exercise

*** Rewrite the notebooks using Python, SymPy https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html to perform analytical computations

Write to me prokudin@jlab.org if you have any questions.
