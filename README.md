Materials for lectures of A. Prokudin at TMD Collaboration School, Santa Fe, 1/22/22

Start by cloning the repository.

Lectures are in the subfolder /Lectures

Run example.nb that shows some plots.

Mathematica exersises I and II are 

sivers.nb
collins.nb

all_solution.nb contains a solution to exercise 0 to reproduce A_LL asymmetry in SIDIS.

# Home work:

* Choose any file sivers.nb or collins.nb. Follow the file, calculate the structure functions and plot the asymmetries. Compare your results to plots from example.nb

* ** Use the definitions of Fourier transforms of TMDs from the TMD handbook Eq. (2.192), (2.193) and show that they give the same results as the ones you obtain in the previous exercise

* *** Rewrite the notebooks using Python, SymPy https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html to perform analytical computations

Write to me prokudin@jlab.org if you have any questions.
